      'The platform, Open Budgets India, has resulted from collective efforts by many organisations and individuals. Increasingly, people across the country are keen to understand and participate meaningfully in discussions on government budgets. But, the limited availability of relevant and accessible information on budgets in India at different levels has been a hindrance in this regard.',
      'In this context, our endeavour is to strengthen the discourse and demand for availability of all budget information in the public domain in a timely and accessible manner, at all levels of government in the country.  The Open Budgets India platform is a comprehensive and user-friendly open data portal that can facilitate free, easy and timely access to relevant data on government budgets in India.',
